stateless widgets are widgets that stay the same in run time
stateless widgets are widgets that make a change in real time

in the login page 
---> we have --> class LoginPage extends StatelessWidget {}
but the username is changing too because the TextFormField() extends a stateful widget inside the stateless

so we select the StatelessWidget in the class above and click the bulb
then select change to stateful
it will create a ---> class _LoginPageState extends State<LoginPage>
